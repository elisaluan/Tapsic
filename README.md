# Tapsic
This project will be a rhythm based game with a Unity GUI and a Arduino controller. There will be a display screen to tell the player which buttons to press and the player will press the corresponding button, or in this case key.

Yellow - "Q" Key
Green - "W" Key
Red - "E" key

A program is used to evaluate how closely the user is able to time their clicks to the graphical cues. However, since the games requires a specific Arduino set up to communicate between serial ports, the game has been adjusted to work using only a laptop/computer.

Run by:
